# Chopsticks

Chopsticks hosts coding agents' native terminal interfaces while providing a
provider-neutral TypeScript runtime for lifecycle, observation, prompt control,
workspace isolation, and operational receipts.

The agent owns its terminal UI. Chopsticks owns the process environment around
that UI and derives semantic state from native hooks or structured protocols,
never by scraping terminal text.

## Packages

- `@vibecook/chopsticks-runtime` — unified runtime and built-in Claude, Codex,
  ACP, and Grok providers.
- `@vibecook/chopsticks-core` — zero-I/O event, state, session, and host
  contracts.
- `@vibecook/chopsticks-workspaces` — direct, exclusive, worktree, and copy
  workspace modes.
- `@vibecook/chopsticks-adapter-{claude,codex,acp,grok}` — provider-specific
  observation and control.
- `@vibecook/chopsticks-record` — append-only records of runtime-owned actions.
- `@vibecook/chopsticks-testing` — fake agent and adapter conformance helpers.

The private Electron workbench is a development application, not part of the
published package graph. Consumers supply an `AgentHost` backed by their own
terminal service.

## Install

```sh
pnpm add @vibecook/chopsticks-runtime@0.1.3
```

Node.js 22 or newer is required.

## Built-in launch options

The selected agent discriminates the available launch options:

```ts
const onApproval = async () => 'denied' as const;

await runtime.createSession({
  agent: 'claude',
  workspace: { mode: 'worktree', path: process.cwd() },
  agentOptions: {
    model: 'sonnet',
    permissionMode: 'plan',
  },
});

await runtime.createSession({
  agent: 'codex',
  agentOptions: {
    model: 'gpt-5.6-sol',
    sandbox: 'read-only',
    approvalPolicy: 'never',
    onApproval,
  },
});

await runtime.createSession({
  agent: 'grok',
  agentOptions: {
    model: 'grok-code-fast',
    permissionMode: 'plan',
    sandbox: 'workspace-write',
    onApproval,
  },
});
```

Generic ACP sessions accept `clientCapabilities`, `onApproval`, and either a
per-session `connector` or the runtime's default `acpConnector`. Codex model and
safety options apply when creating a fresh thread; resumed threads retain their
existing configuration. Approval callbacks are process-lifetime policy seams;
when absent, structured adapters deny approval requests by default.

## Caller-owned terminal adoption

Claude, Codex, and Grok support split-phase launch for PATH shims and other
callers that already own the terminal pane:

```ts
const prepared = await runtime.prepareSession({
  agent: 'codex',
  cwd: process.cwd(),
  agentOptions: { sandbox: 'workspace-write', onApproval },
});
if ('error' in prepared) throw new Error(prepared.error.message);

// Bind the pane before exec so no initial adapter events can race adoption.
const adopted = await runtime.adoptPrepared(prepared.preparationId, {
  runtimeSessionId: pane.id,
  processId: shimPid,
});
if ('error' in adopted) throw new Error(adopted.error.message);

// The shim now chdirs, merges the env delta, and execs command + args exactly.
await shim.exec(prepared.launch);
```

Preparations use opaque ids, allow one terminal binding with idempotent retries,
and expire after 30 seconds by default (`preparationTtlMs` configures this).
`cancelPrepared` cleans up a failed or abandoned launch and is also idempotent.
The caller must report the
adopted vendor process's exit through `handleProcessExit` because the containing
shell/PTY remains alive. `processId` is correlation metadata for that monitor.
The launch environment can contain session bearer tokens and must not be logged
or persisted.

The configured built-in executable should resolve to the real vendor binary,
not the PATH shim, to avoid recursion. Generic ACP has no universal external
attachment transport and returns `PREPARATION_UNSUPPORTED`. Callers should also
fall through to the untouched command when they cannot safely preserve custom
user arguments. Existing `createSession` behavior is unchanged and now shares
the same adapter preparation primitives.

## Development

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm test
pnpm build
pnpm pack:check
```

Live adapter probes are opt-in with `CODEX_LIVE=1`, `GROK_LIVE=1`, or
`CHOPSTICKS_REAL_CLAUDE=1`.

## Versioning

All public Chopsticks packages release in lockstep. Internal `workspace:*`
dependencies are rewritten by pnpm to that exact version in published
tarballs. Applications should pin `@vibecook/chopsticks-runtime` exactly and
upgrade it as a deliberate integration event.

The initial `0.1.0` publication is bootstrapped from the tagged release commit:

```sh
pnpm release:publish
pnpm release:trust
```

`release:publish` verifies, builds, and publishes the public packages in
dependency order, skipping versions already present in the registry.
`release:trust` configures each package to trust `vibecook-dev/chopsticks`'s
`release.yml` GitHub Actions workflow for `npm publish`; it requires npm 11.15
or newer, npm account 2FA, and an authenticated interactive npm session.

Afterward, release-please owns release PRs and tags, and the Release workflow
publishes through tokenless npm trusted publishing. To retry a partial
publication, dispatch the workflow from `main` with the existing release tag:

```sh
gh workflow run release.yml --ref main -f tag=v0.1.1
```
